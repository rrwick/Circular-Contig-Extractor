# Circular Contig Extractor

This repo contains a Python script ([`circular_contig_extractor.py`](circular_contig_extractor.py)) which takes a bacterial genome assembly graph as input and extracts complete circular contigs that assembled separately from the rest of the genome. Circular contigs can be filtered by size and/or by [Mash-distance](https://mash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html#simple-distance-estimation) to a query sequence.

## Example assembly graphs

### Toy example

This toy assembly graph has nine contigs, three of which would be considered circular by `circular_contig_extractor.py` and six of which would not (prefixed with **c** for 'circular' and **n** for 'not').

### Short-read example

Given this short-read assembly graph as input, `circular_contig_extractor.py` will extract the three contigs (all small plasmids) highlighted in blue:

### Long-read example

Given this long-read plate-sweep assembly graph as input, `circular_contig_extractor.py` will extract the 11 contigs (some chromosomes, some plasmids) highlighted in blue:

## Important note

When using `circular_contig_extractor.py` to look for chromosomes or plasmids, false-negative results are common! Sometimes replicons do not cleanly assemble into separate circular contigs, and this script will ignore anything that is not separate and circular. For example, if you are using it to extract small plasmids and get no result, this does not mean that the input genome definitely has no small plasmids. There may be a small plasmid that shares sequence with another replicon, causing it to tangle up in the assembly graph.



## Requirements

You'll need [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8 or later to run `circular_contig_extractor.py`. It's a standalone script and has no Python package dependencies (i.e. it only uses the standard library).

There is one external dependency, [Mash](https://github.com/marbl/Mash), which you'll need installed and callable on your command line. If you can run `mash sketch -h` and `mash dist -h` without getting an error, you should be good to go! Note that if you aren't using the `--query` option (see method below), then the Mash requirement does not apply.



## Installation

Since Circular Contig Extractor is a single script, no installation is required. You can simply clone it and run it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rrwick/Circular-Contig-Extractor
Circular-Contig-Extractor/circular_contig_extractor.py --help
```

If you plan on using it often, you can copy it to someplace in your PATH variable for easier access:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rrwick/Circular-Contig-Extractor
cp Circular-Contig-Extractor/circular_contig_extractor.py ~/.local/bin
circular_contig_extractor.py --help
```

If you'd like to double-check that everything works as intended, you can run this repo's [automated tests](test).



## Method

`circular_contig_extractor.py` loads a GFA and does the following steps:
1. Filter for circular contigs. To count as circular, there needs to be a same-strand link connecting the contig to itself and no links to any other contig. When visualised in [Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage), circular contigs are separate from the rest of the graph (are their own [connected component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory))) and form a loop.
2. Trim off any overlap. If the circularising link has a no-gap [CIGAR string](https://drive5.com/usearch/manual/cigar.html), then the overlapping bases are removed from the end of the contig to produce an overlap-free sequence. This is particularly relevant for SPAdes assemblies which contain overlaps.
3. If `--min` and/or `--max` were used, filter on contig sizes.
4. If `--query` was used, filter on Mash distances. Each sequence in the given FASTA file is considered a separate query, and contigs will pass the filter if they are sufficiently close to any of the queries. For example, you could put two different plasmid sequences in a file called `plasmids.fasta`, call the script with `--query plasmids.fasta`, and any circular contigs which matches either of the plasmid sequences will be included in the output.



## Quick usage

`circular_contig_extractor.py` takes [GFA files](https://gfa-spec.github.io/GFA-spec/GFA1.html) as input, such as those made by [SPAdes](https://github.com/ablab/spades) or [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler). It outputs to stdout in FASTA format.

Get all circular contigs from an assembly graph:

circular_contig_extractor.py --min 1000000 assembly.gfa > small_plasmids.fasta
```

Get complete small plasmids ranging from 1â€“20 kbp in size:
```
circular_contig_extractor.py --min 1000 --max 10000 assembly.gfa > small_plasmids.fasta
```

Get circular contigs that closely match a query sequence:
```
circular_contig_extractor.py --query query.fasta --mash 0.01 assembly.gfa > close_matches.fasta
```

Get circular contigs that distantly match a query sequence:
```
circular_contig_extractor.py --query query.fasta --mash 0.2 assembly.gfa > distant_matches.fasta
```
